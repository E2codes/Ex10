Hi Susan J. Developer,

I have used Docker Compose to set up an environment to address your need for a quick interface to your frog database.
The files contained in this email are:
 docker-compose.yml
 app.py
 init.sql 

Please let us know if this meets ElFroggo's current needs.

Thank You,
E2Codes
